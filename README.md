# Sound_compressor

This project is in process. Now it can only read `signal file` and encode it by transofming it by neural network.

After that **noice.cpp** computes optimal parameters for Rice Code. Then it uses code of Rice to encode and to write decoded file.

It has a function to decode file, but know it has a bag.
